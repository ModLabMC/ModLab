<h1 class="text-5xl text-gray-300">About</h1>

<p class="text-gray-300">Hello to those from the Minecraft modding community! You may be asking yourself the question why I made this website when websites like Modrinth and Curseforge are already a thing?</p>

<p class="text-gray-300">Well I made this because of that <em>Modrinth</em> and <em>Curseforge</em></p>

<p class="text-gray-300">I don't like the fact that are really good mods are on Modrinth and other really good mods are on Curseforge. And you're forced to use which ever one that has the mod you want to play. This is where ModLab comes in, for linking both Modrinth and Curseforge projects.</p>
  
<p class="text-gray-300">Of course I can't put other peoples projects on ModLab, to avoid this I will contact devs asking if I can add there project to this platform. I will also be taking suggestions from owners of projects if you want your project to be added to ModLab it must meet the following requirements:</p>

<p class="text-gray-300">1. The project must be open source.</p>

<p class="text-gray-300">2. The project must be accepted on one of the following sites:</p>

<a href="https://modrinth.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">modrinth.com</a>
<a href="https://curseforge.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">curseforge.com</a>
<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">spigotmc.org</a>
<a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">planetminecraft.com</a>

<p class="text-gray-300">3. Finally if your project meets these requirements you can make a ticket in the <a href="/discord" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">discord server</a>.</p>
