<p class="text-gray-300">Hello to those from the Minecraft modding community! You may be asking yourself the question why I made this website when websites like Modrinth and Curseforge are already a thing?</p>

<p class="text-gray-300">Well I made this because of that <em>Modrinth</em> and <em>Curseforge</em></p>

<p class="text-gray-300">I don't like the fact that are really good mods are on Modrinth and other really good mods are on Curseforge. And you're forced to use which ever one that has the mod you want to play. This is where ModLab comes in, for linking both Modrinth and Curseforge projects.</p>
